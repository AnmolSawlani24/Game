The Cricket Bat-Ball-Stump Game is a simple interactive browser-based game where the user plays against the computer.
The game simulates a simplified version of cricket, allowing the user to choose Bat, Ball, or Stump, and the computer randomly chooses one as well.
The result of each round is displayed immediately on the webpage.

**Gameplay Logic**

Computer choice is randomly generated using Math.random().
Winner is decided based on the following rules:
Bat beats Ball → User wins if Bat beats Ball
Ball beats Stump → User wins if Ball beats Stump
Stump beats Bat → User wins if Stump beats Bat
Same choices result in a Tie
